Description: Crustal deformation modeling tools.  Currently this
    code supports calculation of deformation induced by
    depleting reservoirs (i.e., Geertsma, 1973; Segall, 1985, 1989, 1992; Lambert and Tsai, 2020),
    slipping faults (i.e., Rice and Cleary, 1976; Roeloffs, 1996),
    spherical cavities (i.e., Mogi, 1958), and
    injection point/step sources (i.e., Rudnicki, 1986).
    One can also calculate static and dynamic strains from 
    magnitude-distance relationships.
